        <h1>More Water For Kenya</h1>
        <p>
          The introduction of new water sources, including wells, sand dams,
          spring protections, and rain tanks, aims to address the critical
          water situation in Kenya. <br />Kenya, with its diverse landscape
          of cities, countryside, mountains, and desert, possesses great
          potential amid challenging poverty. <br />
          Despite the inspiring hospitality, kindness, and joy of its
          people, many in Kenya face the harsh reality of not having access
          to clean and safe water. <br />
          Mothers tirelessly search for it, and children resort to
          collecting dirty water when no other options are available,
          leading to a cycle of despair with inevitable health issues and
          increased poverty.
